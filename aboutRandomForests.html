	<p>Much like when one consults multiple experts on an important decision, Random Forests employ an ensemble of Decision Trees to come to a consensus decision. As in the parable of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">The Blind Men and an Elephant</a>, the experts are trained on the same data but with differing versions. The output is the predicted outcome rather than a likelihood estimate.</p>
